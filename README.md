<br>
<li>In the 'New Sentiment Analysis' Spark notebook, the inbuilt function for sentiment analysis from Synapse ML services was then used to get the sentiment from the short descriptions of various news articles present in the table. Currently, its result is not processed further as the AnalyzeText() function is currently not supported in the Western European region.</li>
